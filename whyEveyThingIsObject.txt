interview ask me question on js 
q -  if junior is came to you and ask why every in js in the end is object so how you can explain

Great question — and a common one in JavaScript interviews to test your understanding of how JS works under the hood.

🔹How to explain: “Why everything in JS is an object?” (Simple → Deep)
🪄 1. Start with: “Not everything is literally an object, but...”
In JavaScript, almost everything behaves like an object because the language is designed around a concept called “prototype-based inheritance.”

🔸2. Explain the types clearly:
JavaScript has two broad types of values:

Primitive Types: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint

Objects: Arrays, Functions, Dates, etc.

✅ But here's the twist:
When we use a primitive like a string, JS wraps it temporarily in an object so we can use methods.

js
const name = "Safi";
console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // SAFI
➡️ Behind the scenes: JavaScript does this:

js
new String("Safi").toUpperCase()
This is why even a string behaves like an object — JS automatically “boxes” it into an object temporarily.

🔸3. Prototype Chain (Inheritance)
In JS, objects inherit from other objects via the prototype chain.

Every object has an internal link [[Prototype]] (which you can access via __proto__), and that chain eventually leads to Object.prototype.

So even:

js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
Inherits from:

js
Array.prototype → Object.prototype → null
So in the end, the base object for all other objects is Object.

🔸4. Why did the designers do this?
JavaScript was made to be simple and flexible.

Making everything inherit from Object gives us:

Common methods like .toString(), .hasOwnProperty(), etc.

A uniform way of interacting with different types (Array, Function, Date...).

✅ Summary You Can Say in Interview:
“Not everything in JS is an object, but almost everything behaves like one. Primitives are automatically wrapped to behave like objects when needed, and all complex types inherit from Object via the prototype chain. This makes JavaScript flexible and allows consistent behavior across types.”

Would you like a visual diagram of this prototype chain to explain it better?
